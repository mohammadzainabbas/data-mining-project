# Data Mining Project üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

## Information on files in Directory
- buses.html, shows plots of buses against time.

## Agenda
- Share what we have done till now.

### Minutes of the meeting
### Task 1 & 2)
#### How will we visualize the vehicles speed.
 - Use QGIS for visualization.
 - In order to show delays, we can use colors. Red car if it's late, green if on time, blue
 - backup: use of speed-time plot.

#### Analyse
- Check behavior of the busses on stops. which one they miss.
- Do the busses wait on a stop if they get early, so sync the time ?
- Do trams or train skip the stops ?
- Does time of day affect how long the vehicles stays on a stop ?
- Reduce the granularity of the data and see its impact.

#### Data Cleaning
- Check for time jumps in data. Find and handle time jumps.
- Remove faulty stops from the

#### Find speed of Vehicles
- Flatten the JSON array
- Get distance between 2 stops   # (Important)
  - CHeck data file to see if we can get

## Work divisions
- Vlada: get info on presentation, how did professor use QGIS. Also look into
`exploratory_data_analysis ` python notebook. Open data in QGIS file.
- Ismail: bus
- Mael: Use QGIS for visualization.
- Zain: Analyse the data.


### Questions / ToDos
- How will we be presenting the project.
- Look for a python library to show moving objects on map. (as a backup we will use
heat maps) e.g. pyshape, QGIS, aak prof how he did it.
